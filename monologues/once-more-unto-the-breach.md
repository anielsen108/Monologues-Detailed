# “Once more unto the breach…” — Henry V (Act 3, Scene 1)

## Complete Text

> Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;<br>
> Or close the wall up with our English dead!<br>
> In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man<br>
> As modest stillness and humility:<br>
> But when the blast of war blows in our ears,<br>
> Then imitate the action of the tiger;<br>
> Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,<br>
> Disguise fair nature with hard-favour’d rage;<br>
> Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;<br>
> Let it pry through the portage of the head<br>
> Like the brass cannon; let the brow o’erwhelm it<br>
> As fearfully as doth a galled rock<br>
> O’erhang and jutty his confounded base,<br>
> Swill’d with the wild and wasteful ocean.<br>
> Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,<br>
> Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit<br>
> To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.<br>
> Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!<br>
> Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,<br>
> Have in these parts from morn till even fought<br>
> And sheath’d their swords for lack of argument.<br>
> Dishonour not your mothers; now attest<br>
> That those whom you call’d fathers did beget you.<br>
> Be copy now to men of grosser blood,<br>
> And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,<br>
> Whose limbs were made in England, show us here<br>
> The mettle of your pasture; let us swear<br>
> That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;<br>
> For there is none of you so mean and base,<br>
> That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.<br>
> I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,<br>
> Straining upon the start. The game’s afoot:<br>
> Follow your spirit, and upon this charge<br>
> Cry “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”<br>

Henry rouses his soldiers, moving from explosive battle imagery to intimate appeals.
