# “Once more unto the breach…” — Henry V (Act 3, Scene 1)

## Complete Text

> Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
> Or close the wall up with our English dead!
> In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man
> As modest stillness and humility:
> But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
> Then imitate the action of the tiger;
> Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
> Disguise fair nature with hard-favour’d rage;
> Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
> Let it pry through the portage of the head
> Like the brass cannon; let the brow o’erwhelm it
> As fearfully as doth a galled rock
> O’erhang and jutty his confounded base,
> Swill’d with the wild and wasteful ocean.
> Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
> Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
> To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.
> Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
> Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
> Have in these parts from morn till even fought
> And sheath’d their swords for lack of argument.
> Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
> That those whom you call’d fathers did beget you.
> Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
> And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,
> Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
> The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
> That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
> For there is none of you so mean and base,
> That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
> I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
> Straining upon the start. The game’s afoot:
> Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
> Cry “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”

Henry rouses his soldiers, moving from explosive battle imagery to intimate appeals.
