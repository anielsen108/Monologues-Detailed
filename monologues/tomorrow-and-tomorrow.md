# “Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow…” — Macbeth (Act 5, Scene 5)

## Complete Text

> Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,<br>
> Creeps in this petty pace from day to day<br>
> To the last syllable of recorded time;<br>
> And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br>
> The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br>
> Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player<br>
> That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br>
> And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br>
> Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br>
> Signifying nothing.<br>

Macbeth processes Lady Macbeth’s death with fatalistic monotony, letting time feel like suffocating dust.
