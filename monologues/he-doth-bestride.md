# “Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world…” — Julius Caesar (Act 1, Scene 2)

## Complete Text

> Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
> Like a Colossus, and we petty men
> Walk under his huge legs and peep about
> To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
> Men at some time are masters of their fates:
> The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
> But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
> Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that ‘Caesar’?
> Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
> Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
> Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
> Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,
> ‘Brutus’ will start a spirit as soon as ‘Caesar’.
> Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
> Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
> That he is grown so great? Age, thou art sham’d!
> Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
> When went there by an age, since the great flood,
> But it was fam’d with more than with one man?
> When could they say, till now, that talk’d of Rome,
> That her wide walls encompass’d but one man?
> Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,
> When there is in it but one only man.
> O! you and I have heard our fathers say,
> There was a Brutus once that would have brook’d
> Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
> As easily as a king.

Cassius inflames Brutus against Caesar by painting him as an overgrown colossus while they remain mere men.
