## Complete Text

> Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world<br>
> Like a Colossus, and we petty men<br>
> Walk under his huge legs and peep about<br>
> To find ourselves dishonourable graves.<br>
> Men at some time are masters of their fates:<br>
> The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<br>
> But in ourselves, that we are underlings.<br>
> Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that ‘Caesar’?<br>
> Why should that name be sounded more than yours?<br>
> Write them together, yours is as fair a name;<br>
> Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;<br>
> Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,<br>
> ‘Brutus’ will start a spirit as soon as ‘Caesar’.<br>
> Now, in the names of all the gods at once,<br>
> Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed<br>
> That he is grown so great? Age, thou art sham’d!<br>
> Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!<br>
> When went there by an age, since the great flood,<br>
> But it was fam’d with more than with one man?<br>
> When could they say, till now, that talk’d of Rome,<br>
> That her wide walls encompass’d but one man?<br>
> Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,<br>
> When there is in it but one only man.<br>
> O! you and I have heard our fathers say,<br>
> There was a Brutus once that would have brook’d<br>
> Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome<br>
> As easily as a king.<br>

Cassius inflames Brutus against Caesar by painting him as an overgrown colossus while they remain mere men.
