# “Was this the face that launched a thousand ships…” — Doctor Faustus (Act 5)

## Complete Text

> Was this the face that launch’d a thousand ships,
> And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?—
> Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.—
> Her lips suck forth my soul: see, where it flies!—
> Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.
> Here will I dwell, for heaven is in these lips,
> And all is dross that is not Helena.
> I will be Paris, and for love of thee,
> Instead of Troy, shall Wittenberg be sack’d;
> And I will combat with weak Menelaus,
> And wear thy colours on my plumed crest;
> Yea, I will wound Achilles in the heel,
> And then return to Helen for a kiss.
> O thou art fairer than the evening air
> Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;
> Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter
> When he appear’d to hapless Semele;
> More lovely than the monarch of the sky
> In wanton Arethusa’s azur’d arms;
> And none but thou shalt be my paramour!

Faustus idolizes Helen as a last escape from damnation, the tone turning sensuous and fatalistic.
