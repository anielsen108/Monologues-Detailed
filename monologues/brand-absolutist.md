# Brand’s Absolutist Monologues — Brand

## Complete Text

> All or nothing! That cry has been the storm-bell of my blood since boyhood, when the fjord winds beat it into me. God’s kingdom is no huckster’s stall where souls may cheapen their obedience. What He demands must stand whole; to offer less is blasphemy. Give up the lie that half a heart, half a will, can satisfy eternity. The spirit that would save itself must fling itself entire, as the eagle flings into the abyss, trusting the unseen updraft. What are home, kin, bread, even the child at a mother’s breast, if they tempt us to spare ourselves? Strike them from the ledger, tear them out root and branch, before you parley with compromise. Look around you: the valley rots because men will bargain—“So much for God, so much for comfort.” I tell you, God accepts no divided coin. One day the avalanche of His judgment will thunder down upon the luke-warm, and the coward’s prayer will freeze upon his tongue. Therefore I proclaim it, to friend and foe alike: give all, stake all, or stand condemned. The will that quails before the utmost demand has already died. All or nothing!—this is the covenant I seal with every breath.<br>

Brand insists on “all or nothing,” demanding total sacrifice from himself and others.
