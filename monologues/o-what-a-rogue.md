# “O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I…” — Hamlet (Act 2, Scene 2)

## Complete Text

> O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!<br>
> Is it not monstrous that this player here,<br>
> But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,<br>
> Could force his soul so to his own conceit<br>
> That from her working all his visage wann’d;<br>
> Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,<br>
> A broken voice, and his whole function suiting<br>
> With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!<br>
> For Hecuba!<br>
> What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,<br>
> That he should weep for her? What would he do,<br>
> Had he the motive and the cue for passion<br>
> That I have? He would drown the stage with tears<br>
> And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,<br>
> Make mad the guilty and appal the free,<br>
> Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed<br>
> The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,<br>
> A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,<br>
> Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br>
> And can say nothing; no, not for a king,<br>
> Upon whose property and most dear life<br>
> A damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward?<br>
> Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?<br>
> Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?<br>
> Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i’ the throat,<br>
> As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?<br>
> Ha! ’swounds, I should take it; for it cannot be<br>
> But I am pigeon-liver’d and lack gall<br>
> To make oppression bitter, or ere this<br>
> I should have fatted all the region kites<br>
> With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!<br>
> Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!<br>
> O, vengeance!<br>
> Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,<br>
> That I, the son of a dear father murder’d,<br>
> Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,<br>
> Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,<br>
> And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,<br>
> A scullion!<br>
> Fie upon’t! foh! About, my brains! hum! I have heard<br>
> That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,<br>
> Have by the very cunning of the scene<br>
> Been struck so to the soul that presently<br>
> They have proclaim’d their malefactions;<br>
> For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br>
> With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players<br>
> Play something like the murder of my father<br>
> Before mine uncle: I’ll observe his looks;<br>
> I’ll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,<br>
> I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br>
> May be the devil: and the devil hath power<br>
> To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,<br>
> Out of my weakness and my melancholy,<br>
> As he is very potent with such spirits,<br>
> Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds<br>
> More relative than this: the play’s the thing<br>
> Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.<br>

Hamlet lashes himself for inaction, swinging between admiration for the Player King and rage that his own passion remains theoretical.
