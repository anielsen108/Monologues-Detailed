# “O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I…” — Hamlet (Act 2, Scene 2)

## Complete Text

> O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
> Is it not monstrous that this player here,
> But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
> Could force his soul so to his own conceit
> That from her working all his visage wann’d;
> Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,
> A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
> With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
> For Hecuba!
> What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
> That he should weep for her? What would he do,
> Had he the motive and the cue for passion
> That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
> And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
> Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
> Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
> The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
> A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
> Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
> And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
> Upon whose property and most dear life
> A damn’d defeat was made. Am I a coward?
> Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
> Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
> Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i’ the throat,
> As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
> Ha! ’swounds, I should take it; for it cannot be
> But I am pigeon-liver’d and lack gall
> To make oppression bitter, or ere this
> I should have fatted all the region kites
> With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!
> Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
> O, vengeance!
> Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
> That I, the son of a dear father murder’d,
> Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
> Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
> And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
> A scullion!
> Fie upon’t! foh! About, my brains! hum! I have heard
> That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
> Have by the very cunning of the scene
> Been struck so to the soul that presently
> They have proclaim’d their malefactions;
> For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
> With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players
> Play something like the murder of my father
> Before mine uncle: I’ll observe his looks;
> I’ll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
> I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
> May be the devil: and the devil hath power
> To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,
> Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
> As he is very potent with such spirits,
> Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds
> More relative than this: the play’s the thing
> Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.

Hamlet lashes himself for inaction, swinging between admiration for the Player King and rage that his own passion remains theoretical.
