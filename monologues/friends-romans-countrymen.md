## Complete Text

> Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;<br>
> I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br>
> The evil that men do lives after them;<br>
> The good is oft interrèd with their bones;<br>
> So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br>
> Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:<br>
> If it were so, it was a grievous fault;<br>
> And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.<br>
> Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest—<br>
> For Brutus is an honourable man;<br>
> So are they all, all honourable men—<br>
> Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.<br>
> He was my friend, faithful and just to me:<br>
> But Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
> And Brutus is an honourable man.<br>
> He hath brought many captives home to Rome,<br>
> Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<br>
> Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br>
> When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:<br>
> Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br>
> Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
> And Brutus is an honourable man.<br>
> You all did see that on the Lupercal<br>
> I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br>
> Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?<br>
> Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
> And, sure, he is an honourable man.<br>
> I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br>
> But here I am to speak what I do know.<br>
> You all did love him once, not without cause:<br>
> What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?<br>
> O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>
> And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;<br>
> My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<br>
> And I must pause till it come back to me.<br>
><br>
> But yesterday the word of Caesar might<br>
> Have stood against the world; now lies he there,<br>
> And none so poor to do him reverence.<br>
> O masters! if I were dispos’d to stir<br>
> Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,<br>
> I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,<br>
> Who, you all know, are honourable men:<br>
> I will not do them wrong; I rather choose<br>
> To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,<br>
> Than I will wrong such honourable men.<br>
> But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar;<br>
> I found it in his closet, ’tis his will:<br>
> Let but the commons hear this testament—<br>
> Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read—<br>
> And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds<br>
> And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;<br>
> Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,<br>
> And, dying, mention it within their wills,<br>
> Bequeathing it as a rich legacy<br>
> Unto their issue.<br>
><br>
> If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.<br>
> You all do know this mantle: I remember<br>
> The first time ever Caesar put it on;<br>
> ’Twas on a summer’s evening, in his tent,<br>
> That day he overcame the Nervii:<br>
> Look! in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through:<br>
> See what a rent the envious Casca made:<br>
> Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb’d;<br>
> And as he pluck’d his cursèd steel away,<br>
> Mark how the blood of Caesar follow’d it,<br>
> As rushing out of doors, to be resolv’d<br>
> If Brutus so unkindly knock’d, or no;<br>
> For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel:<br>
> Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar lov’d him!<br>
> This was the most unkindest cut of all;<br>
> For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,<br>
> Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,<br>
> Quite vanquish’d him: then burst his mighty heart;<br>
> And, in his mantle muffling up his face,<br>
> Even at the base of Pompey’s statua,<br>
> Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.<br>
> O what a fall was there, my countrymen!<br>
> Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,<br>
> Whilst bloody treason flourish’d over us.<br>
> O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel<br>
> The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.<br>
> Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold<br>
> Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here,<br>
> Here is himself, marr’d, as you see, with traitors.<br>
><br>
> Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up<br>
> To such a sudden flood of mutiny.<br>
> They that have done this deed are honourable:<br>
> What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,<br>
> That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,<br>
> And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.<br>
> I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:<br>
> I am no orator, as Brutus is;<br>
> But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,<br>
> That love my friend; and that they know full well<br>
> That gave me public leave to speak of him.<br>
> For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,<br>
> Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,<br>
> To stir men’s blood: I only speak right on;<br>
> I tell you that which you yourselves do know;<br>
> Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor dumb mouths,<br>
> And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,<br>
> And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony<br>
> Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue<br>
> In every wound of Caesar, that should move<br>
> The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.<br>
><br>
> Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.<br>
> Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:<br>
> Wherein hath Caesar thus deserv’d your loves?<br>
> Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:<br>
> You have forgot the will I told you of.<br>
> Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal.<br>
> To every Roman citizen he gives,<br>
> To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.<br>
> Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,<br>
> His private arbours, and new-planted orchards,<br>
> On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,<br>
> And to your heirs for ever; common pleasures,<br>
> To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.<br>
> Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?<br>
