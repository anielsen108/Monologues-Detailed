# Friends, Romans, Countrymen — Julius Caesar (Act 3, Scene 2)

## Complete Text

> Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
> I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
> The evil that men do lives after them;
> The good is oft interrèd with their bones;
> So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
> Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
> If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
> And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.
> Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest—
> For Brutus is an honourable man;
> So are they all, all honourable men—
> Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.
> He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
> But Brutus says he was ambitious;
> And Brutus is an honourable man.
> He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
> Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
> Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
> When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
> Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
> Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
> And Brutus is an honourable man.
> You all did see that on the Lupercal
> I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
> Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
> Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
> And, sure, he is an honourable man.
> I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
> But here I am to speak what I do know.
> You all did love him once, not without cause:
> What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
> O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
> And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
> My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
> And I must pause till it come back to me.
>
> But yesterday the word of Caesar might
> Have stood against the world; now lies he there,
> And none so poor to do him reverence.
> O masters! if I were dispos’d to stir
> Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
> I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
> Who, you all know, are honourable men:
> I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
> To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
> Than I will wrong such honourable men.
> But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
> I found it in his closet, ’tis his will:
> Let but the commons hear this testament—
> Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read—
> And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds
> And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;
> Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
> And, dying, mention it within their wills,
> Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
> Unto their issue.
>
> If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
> You all do know this mantle: I remember
> The first time ever Caesar put it on;
> ’Twas on a summer’s evening, in his tent,
> That day he overcame the Nervii:
> Look! in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through:
> See what a rent the envious Casca made:
> Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb’d;
> And as he pluck’d his cursèd steel away,
> Mark how the blood of Caesar follow’d it,
> As rushing out of doors, to be resolv’d
> If Brutus so unkindly knock’d, or no;
> For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel:
> Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar lov’d him!
> This was the most unkindest cut of all;
> For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
> Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,
> Quite vanquish’d him: then burst his mighty heart;
> And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
> Even at the base of Pompey’s statua,
> Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
> O what a fall was there, my countrymen!
> Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
> Whilst bloody treason flourish’d over us.
> O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
> The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
> Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
> Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here,
> Here is himself, marr’d, as you see, with traitors.
>
> Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
> To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
> They that have done this deed are honourable:
> What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
> That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
> And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
> I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
> I am no orator, as Brutus is;
> But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
> That love my friend; and that they know full well
> That gave me public leave to speak of him.
> For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
> Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
> To stir men’s blood: I only speak right on;
> I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
> Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor dumb mouths,
> And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
> And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
> Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
> In every wound of Caesar, that should move
> The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
>
> Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
> Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
> Wherein hath Caesar thus deserv’d your loves?
> Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
> You have forgot the will I told you of.
> Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal.
> To every Roman citizen he gives,
> To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
> Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
> His private arbours, and new-planted orchards,
> On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
> And to your heirs for ever; common pleasures,
> To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
> Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
