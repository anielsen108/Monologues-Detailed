# “If it were done when ’tis done…” — Macbeth (Act 1, Scene 7)

## Complete Text

> If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well<br>
> It were done quickly: if th’ assassination<br>
> Could trammel up the consequence, and catch<br>
> With his surcease success; that but this blow<br>
> Might be the be-all and the end-all here,<br>
> But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,<br>
> We’d jump the life to come. But in these cases<br>
> We still have judgment here; that we but teach<br>
> Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return<br>
> To plague th’ inventor: this even-handed justice<br>
> Commends th’ ingredients of our poison’d chalice<br>
> To our own lips. He’s here in double trust:<br>
> First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,<br>
> Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,<br>
> Who should against his murderer shut the door,<br>
> Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan<br>
> Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been<br>
> So clear in his great office, that his virtues<br>
> Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongu’d, against<br>
> The deep damnation of his taking-off;<br>
> And pity, like a naked new-born babe,<br>
> Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubins, hors’d<br>
> Upon the sightless couriers of the air,<br>
> Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,<br>
> That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur<br>
> To prick the sides of my intent, but only<br>
> Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself<br>
> And falls on th’ other.<br>
