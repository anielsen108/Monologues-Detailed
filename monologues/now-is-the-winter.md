# “Now is the winter of our discontent…” — Richard III (Act 1, Scene 1)

## Complete Text

> Now is the winter of our discontent<br>
> Made glorious summer by this sun of York;<br>
> And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house<br>
> In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.<br>
> Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;<br>
> Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;<br>
> Our stern alarums chang’d to merry meetings,<br>
> Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.<br>
> Grim-visag’d war hath smooth’d his wrinkled front;<br>
> And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds<br>
> To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,<br>
> He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber<br>
> To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.<br>
> But I, that am not shap’d for sportive tricks,<br>
> Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;<br>
> I, that am rudely stamp’d, and want love’s majesty<br>
> To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;<br>
> I, that am curtail’d of this fair proportion,<br>
> Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,<br>
> Deform’d, unfinish’d, sent before my time<br>
> Into this breathing world scarce half made up,<br>
> And that so lamely and unfashionable<br>
> That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;<br>
> Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,<br>
> Have no delight to pass away the time,<br>
> Unless to spy my shadow in the sun<br>
> And descant on mine own deformity.<br>
> And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover<br>
> To entertain these fair well-spoken days,<br>
> I am determinèd to prove a villain<br>
> And hate the idle pleasures of these days.<br>
> Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,<br>
> By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,<br>
> To set my brother Clarence and the king<br>
> In deadly hate the one against the other;<br>
> And if King Edward be as true and just<br>
> As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,<br>
> This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up,<br>
> About a prophecy which says that ‘G’<br>
> Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.<br>
> Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here Clarence comes.<br>

Richard opens with sardonic celebration before revealing his isolation and plotting. The delivery slides from public pomp to private snarl.
