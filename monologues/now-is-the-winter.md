# “Now is the winter of our discontent…” — Richard III (Act 1, Scene 1)

## Complete Text

> Now is the winter of our discontent
> Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
> And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house
> In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
> Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
> Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
> Our stern alarums chang’d to merry meetings,
> Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
> Grim-visag’d war hath smooth’d his wrinkled front;
> And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
> To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
> He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber
> To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
> But I, that am not shap’d for sportive tricks,
> Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
> I, that am rudely stamp’d, and want love’s majesty
> To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
> I, that am curtail’d of this fair proportion,
> Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
> Deform’d, unfinish’d, sent before my time
> Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
> And that so lamely and unfashionable
> That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
> Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
> Have no delight to pass away the time,
> Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
> And descant on mine own deformity.
> And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
> To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
> I am determinèd to prove a villain
> And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
> Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
> By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
> To set my brother Clarence and the king
> In deadly hate the one against the other;
> And if King Edward be as true and just
> As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
> This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up,
> About a prophecy which says that ‘G’
> Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.
> Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here Clarence comes.

Richard opens with sardonic celebration before revealing his isolation and plotting. The delivery slides from public pomp to private snarl.
