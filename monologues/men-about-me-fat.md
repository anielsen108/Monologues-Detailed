# “Let me have men about me that are fat…” — Julius Caesar (Act 1, Scene 2)

## Complete Text

> Let me have men about me that are fat;
> Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o’ nights:
> Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
> He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
> Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
> Yet if my name were liable to fear,
> I do not know the man I should avoid
> So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
> He is a great observer, and he looks
> Quite through the deeds of men; he loves no plays,
> As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
> Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
> As if he mock’d himself, and scorn’d his spirit
> That could be mov’d to smile at anything.
> Such men as he be never at heart’s ease
> Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
> And therefore are they very dangerous.
> I rather tell thee what is to be fear’d
> Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
> Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
> And tell me truly what thou think’st of him.

Caesar confides to Antony his distrust of Cassius, using physical description to signal political danger.
