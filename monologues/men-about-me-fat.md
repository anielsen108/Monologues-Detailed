# “Let me have men about me that are fat…” — Julius Caesar (Act 1, Scene 2)

## Complete Text

> Let me have men about me that are fat;<br>
> Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o’ nights:<br>
> Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;<br>
> He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.<br>
> Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:<br>
> Yet if my name were liable to fear,<br>
> I do not know the man I should avoid<br>
> So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;<br>
> He is a great observer, and he looks<br>
> Quite through the deeds of men; he loves no plays,<br>
> As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;<br>
> Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort<br>
> As if he mock’d himself, and scorn’d his spirit<br>
> That could be mov’d to smile at anything.<br>
> Such men as he be never at heart’s ease<br>
> Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,<br>
> And therefore are they very dangerous.<br>
> I rather tell thee what is to be fear’d<br>
> Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.<br>
> Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,<br>
> And tell me truly what thou think’st of him.<br>
