# “All the world’s a stage…” — As You Like It (Act 2, Scene 7)

## Complete Text

> All the world’s a stage,<br>
> And all the men and women merely players;<br>
> They have their exits and their entrances;<br>
> And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
> His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<br>
> Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.<br>
> And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel<br>
> And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
> Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
> Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
> Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
> Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,<br>
> Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
> Seeking the bubble reputation<br>
> Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,<br>
> In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,<br>
> With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
> Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
> And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
> Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,<br>
> With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br>
> His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide<br>
> For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,<br>
> Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br>
> And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br>
> That ends this strange eventful history,<br>
> Is second childishness and mere oblivion,<br>
> Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.<br>

Jaques’s melancholy philosophy surveys life’s seven ages with ironic wit.
