# Faustus’ Final Soliloquy — Doctor Faustus (Act 5)

## Complete Text

> Ah, Faustus,<br>
> Now hast thou but one bare hour to live,<br>
> And then thou must be damn’d perpetually!<br>
> Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven,<br>
> That time may cease, and midnight never come;<br>
> Fair Nature’s eye, rise, rise again, and make<br>
> Perpetual day; or let this hour be but<br>
> A year, a month, a week, a natural day,<br>
> That Faustus may repent and save his soul!<br>
> O lente, lente currite, noctis equi!<br>
> The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike,<br>
> The devil will come, and Faustus must be damn’d.<br>
> O, I’ll leap up to my God! Who pulls me down?<br>
> See, see where Christ’s blood streams in the firmament!<br>
> One drop would save my soul, half a drop: ah, my Christ!—<br>
> Ah, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ;<br>
> Yet will I call on him. O spare me, Lucifer!—<br>
> Where is it now? ’tis gone; and see where God<br>
> Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows!<br>
> Mountains and hills, come, come, and fall on me,<br>
> And hide me from the heavy wrath of God!<br>
> No? then will I headlong run into the earth:<br>
> Earth, gape! O no, it will not harbour me.<br>
> You stars that reign’d at my nativity,<br>
> Whose influence hath allotted death and hell,<br>
> Now draw up Faustus, like a foggy mist,<br>
> Into the entrails of yon labouring cloud,<br>
> That when they vomit forth into the air<br>
> My limbs may issue from their smoky mouths;<br>
> But let my soul mount and ascend to heaven.<br>
> The clock strikes twelve.<br>
> O, it strikes, it strikes! Now, body, turn to air,<br>
> Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell.<br>
> O soul, be chang’d into small water-drops,<br>
> And fall into the ocean, ne’er be found!<br>
> Thunder and lightning.<br>
> My God, my God, look not so fierce on me!<br>
> Adders and serpents, let me breathe a while!<br>
> Ugly hell, gape not! Come not, Lucifer!<br>
> I’ll burn my books!—Ah, Mephistopheles!<br>

Faustus begs for time and mercy as midnight approaches, collapsing from bombastic scholar to terrified child.
