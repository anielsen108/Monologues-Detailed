# Faustus’ Final Soliloquy — Doctor Faustus (Act 5)

## Complete Text

> Ah, Faustus,
> Now hast thou but one bare hour to live,
> And then thou must be damn’d perpetually!
> Stand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven,
> That time may cease, and midnight never come;
> Fair Nature’s eye, rise, rise again, and make
> Perpetual day; or let this hour be but
> A year, a month, a week, a natural day,
> That Faustus may repent and save his soul!
> O lente, lente currite, noctis equi!
> The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike,
> The devil will come, and Faustus must be damn’d.
> O, I’ll leap up to my God! Who pulls me down?
> See, see where Christ’s blood streams in the firmament!
> One drop would save my soul, half a drop: ah, my Christ!—
> Ah, rend not my heart for naming of my Christ;
> Yet will I call on him. O spare me, Lucifer!—
> Where is it now? ’tis gone; and see where God
> Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows!
> Mountains and hills, come, come, and fall on me,
> And hide me from the heavy wrath of God!
> No? then will I headlong run into the earth:
> Earth, gape! O no, it will not harbour me.
> You stars that reign’d at my nativity,
> Whose influence hath allotted death and hell,
> Now draw up Faustus, like a foggy mist,
> Into the entrails of yon labouring cloud,
> That when they vomit forth into the air
> My limbs may issue from their smoky mouths;
> But let my soul mount and ascend to heaven.
> The clock strikes twelve.
> O, it strikes, it strikes! Now, body, turn to air,
> Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell.
> O soul, be chang’d into small water-drops,
> And fall into the ocean, ne’er be found!
> Thunder and lightning.
> My God, my God, look not so fierce on me!
> Adders and serpents, let me breathe a while!
> Ugly hell, gape not! Come not, Lucifer!
> I’ll burn my books!—Ah, Mephistopheles!

Faustus begs for time and mercy as midnight approaches, collapsing from bombastic scholar to terrified child.
