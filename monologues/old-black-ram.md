# “Even now, now, very now, an old black ram…” — Othello (Act 1, Scene 1)

## Complete Text

> ’Zounds, sir, you’re robb’d; for shame, put on your gown;
> Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
> Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
> Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
> Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
> Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
> Arise, I say.
>
> ’Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you.
> Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians,
> You’ll have your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse;
> You’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
> I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor
> Are now making the beast with two backs.
