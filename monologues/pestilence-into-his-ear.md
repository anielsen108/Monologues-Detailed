# “I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear…” — Othello (Act 2, Scene 3)

## Complete Text

> And what’s he then that says I play the villain?<br>
> When this advice is free I give and honest,<br>
> Probal to thinking, and indeed the course<br>
> To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy<br>
> Th’ inclining Desdemona to subdue<br>
> In any honest suit: she’s fram’d as fruitful<br>
> As the free elements. And then for her<br>
> To win the Moor—were’t to renounce his baptism,<br>
> All seals and symbols of redeem’d sin—<br>
> His soul is so enfetter’d to her love<br>
> That she may make, unmake, do what she list,<br>
> Even as her appetite shall play the god<br>
> With his weak function. How am I then a villain<br>
> To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,<br>
> Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!<br>
> When devils will the blackest sins put on,<br>
> They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,<br>
> As I do now: for whiles this honest fool<br>
> Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes,<br>
> And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,<br>
> I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear,<br>
> That she repeals him for her body’s lust;<br>
> And by how much she strives to do him good,<br>
> She shall undo her credit with the Moor.<br>
> So will I turn her virtue into pitch,<br>
> And out of her own goodness make the net<br>
> That shall enmesh them all.<br>
