# “I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear…” — Othello (Act 2, Scene 3)

## Complete Text

> And what’s he then that says I play the villain?
> When this advice is free I give and honest,
> Probal to thinking, and indeed the course
> To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy
> Th’ inclining Desdemona to subdue
> In any honest suit: she’s fram’d as fruitful
> As the free elements. And then for her
> To win the Moor—were’t to renounce his baptism,
> All seals and symbols of redeem’d sin—
> His soul is so enfetter’d to her love
> That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
> Even as her appetite shall play the god
> With his weak function. How am I then a villain
> To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
> Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
> When devils will the blackest sins put on,
> They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
> As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
> Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes,
> And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
> I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear,
> That she repeals him for her body’s lust;
> And by how much she strives to do him good,
> She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
> So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
> And out of her own goodness make the net
> That shall enmesh them all.

Iago outlines the plan to poison Othello’s trust, relishing psychological warfare.
