# Solness’ Fear of Youth Speech — The Master Builder

## Complete Text

> I am afraid of the young, Hilde; they come knocking with fresh song on their lips, and the world opens to them as it once opened to me. They climb the scaffolds with clear eyes and steady hands, and I—who have built towers that set bells ringing over the town—feel my knees tremble. It is not only that they are strong; it is that they are boundlessly sure they have the right to build. I have stolen luck from others, trampled little hopes to raise my castles. Do you know what it costs to stand at the top? The old vines down below keep whispering: “Your time is past, Solness. Make room.” Sometimes I think the youth have a secret pact with the trolls: they smile and the walls crumble under me. Yet when I see you, Hilde, blazing like the flag at the masthead, something in me longs to dare once more. If only I could believe that the young might love me, not merely supplant me! But the fear clings: that they will take my towers, my dreams, and leave me on the ground with empty hands. Still—I will climb, though the dizziness seize me. Better to fall from the spire than to rot slowly on the earth.<br>

Halvard Solness confesses to Hilde that he fears the young will overtake him.
