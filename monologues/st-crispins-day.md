# “St. Crispin’s Day Speech” — Henry V (Act 4, Scene 3)

## Complete Text

> If we are mark’d to die, we are enow
> To do our country loss; and if to live,
> The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
> God’s will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
> By Jove, I am not covetous for gold;
> Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
> It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
> Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
> But if it be a sin to covet honour,
> I am the most offending soul alive.
> No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.
> God’s peace! I would not lose so great an honour
> As one man more methinks would share from me,
> For the best hope I have. O! do not wish one more.
> Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
> That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
> Let him depart; his passport shall be made
> And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
> We would not die in that man’s company
> That fears his fellowship to die with us.
>
> This day is call’d the feast of Crispian:
> He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
> Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam’d,
> And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
> He that shall live this day, and see old age,
> Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
> And say “To-morrow is Saint Crispian.”
> Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,
> And say “These wounds I had on Crispin’s day.”
> Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,
> But he’ll remember, with advantages,
> What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,
> Familiar in their mouths as household words—
> Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
> Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester—
> Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb’red.
> This story shall the good man teach his son;
> And Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by,
> From this day to the ending of the world,
> But we in it shall be remember’d;
> We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
> For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
> Shall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile,
> This day shall gentle his condition:
> And gentlemen in England now a-bed
> Shall think themselves accurs’d they were not here,
> And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
> That fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.

Henry reframes numerical disadvantage as eternal glory, weaving in fellowship and legacy.
