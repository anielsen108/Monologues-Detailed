# “St. Crispin’s Day Speech” — Henry V (Act 4, Scene 3)

## Complete Text

> If we are mark’d to die, we are enow<br>
> To do our country loss; and if to live,<br>
> The fewer men, the greater share of honour.<br>
> God’s will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.<br>
> By Jove, I am not covetous for gold;<br>
> Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;<br>
> It yearns me not if men my garments wear;<br>
> Such outward things dwell not in my desires:<br>
> But if it be a sin to covet honour,<br>
> I am the most offending soul alive.<br>
> No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.<br>
> God’s peace! I would not lose so great an honour<br>
> As one man more methinks would share from me,<br>
> For the best hope I have. O! do not wish one more.<br>
> Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,<br>
> That he which hath no stomach to this fight,<br>
> Let him depart; his passport shall be made<br>
> And crowns for convoy put into his purse:<br>
> We would not die in that man’s company<br>
> That fears his fellowship to die with us.<br>
><br>
> This day is call’d the feast of Crispian:<br>
> He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,<br>
> Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam’d,<br>
> And rouse him at the name of Crispian.<br>
> He that shall live this day, and see old age,<br>
> Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,<br>
> And say “To-morrow is Saint Crispian.”<br>
> Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,<br>
> And say “These wounds I had on Crispin’s day.”<br>
> Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,<br>
> But he’ll remember, with advantages,<br>
> What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,<br>
> Familiar in their mouths as household words—<br>
> Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,<br>
> Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester—<br>
> Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb’red.<br>
> This story shall the good man teach his son;<br>
> And Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by,<br>
> From this day to the ending of the world,<br>
> But we in it shall be remember’d;<br>
> We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;<br>
> For he to-day that sheds his blood with me<br>
> Shall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile,<br>
> This day shall gentle his condition:<br>
> And gentlemen in England now a-bed<br>
> Shall think themselves accurs’d they were not here,<br>
> And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks<br>
> That fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.<br>

Henry reframes numerical disadvantage as eternal glory, weaving in fellowship and legacy.
