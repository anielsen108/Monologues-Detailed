# “To be, or not to be…” — Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 1)

## Complete Text

> To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br>
> Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
> The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
> Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>
> And by opposing end them. To die: to sleep;<br>
> No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
> The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
> That flesh is heir to, ’tis a consummation<br>
> Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep;<br>
> To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub;<br>
> For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br>
> When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
> Must give us pause: there’s the respect<br>
> That makes calamity of so long life;<br>
> For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
> Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,<br>
> The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,<br>
> The insolence of office and the spurns<br>
> That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br>
> When he himself might his quietus make<br>
> With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br>
> To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
> But that the dread of something after death,<br>
> The undiscover’d country from whose bourn<br>
> No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br>
> And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
> Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>
> Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br>
> And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
> Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,<br>
> And enterprises of great pitch and moment<br>
> With this regard their currents turn awry,<br>
> And lose the name of action.—Soft you now!<br>
> The fair Ophelia!—Nymph, in thy orisons<br>
> Be all my sins remember’d.<br>

Hamlet measures the ethics of action versus endurance, using a hushed, philosophical tessitura that blossoms only when he imagines release from suffering.
