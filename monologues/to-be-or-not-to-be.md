# “To be, or not to be…” — Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 1)

## Complete Text

> To be, or not to be: that is the question:
> Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
> The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
> Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
> And by opposing end them. To die: to sleep;
> No more; and by a sleep to say we end
> The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
> That flesh is heir to, ’tis a consummation
> Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep;
> To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub;
> For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
> When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
> Must give us pause: there’s the respect
> That makes calamity of so long life;
> For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
> Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,
> The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,
> The insolence of office and the spurns
> That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
> When he himself might his quietus make
> With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
> To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
> But that the dread of something after death,
> The undiscover’d country from whose bourn
> No traveller returns, puzzles the will
> And makes us rather bear those ills we have
> Than fly to others that we know not of?
> Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
> And thus the native hue of resolution
> Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,
> And enterprises of great pitch and moment
> With this regard their currents turn awry,
> And lose the name of action.—Soft you now!
> The fair Ophelia!—Nymph, in thy orisons
> Be all my sins remember’d.

Hamlet measures the ethics of action versus endurance, using a hushed, philosophical tessitura that blossoms only when he imagines release from suffering.
