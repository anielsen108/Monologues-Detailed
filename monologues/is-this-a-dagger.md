# “Is this a dagger which I see before me…” — Macbeth (Act 2, Scene 1)

## Complete Text

> Is this a dagger which I see before me,
> The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
> I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
> Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
> To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
> A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
> Proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain?
> I see thee yet, in form as palpable
> As this which now I draw.
> Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going;
> And such an instrument I was to use.
> Mine eyes are made the fools o’ th’ other senses,
> Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
> And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
> Which was not so before. There’s no such thing:
> It is the bloody business which informs
> Thus to mine eyes. Now o’er the one half-world
> Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
> The curtain’d sleep; witchcraft celebrates
> Pale Hecate’s offerings; and wither’d Murder,
> Alarum’d by his sentinel, the wolf,
> Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
> With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design
> Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
> Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
> Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
> And take the present horror from the time,
> Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
> Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
>
> I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
> Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
> That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

Macbeth hallucinates the dagger, testing his own senses as he moves toward Duncan’s chamber.
