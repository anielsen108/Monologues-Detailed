# “Is this a dagger which I see before me…” — Macbeth (Act 2, Scene 1)

## Complete Text

> Is this a dagger which I see before me,<br>
> The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.<br>
> I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.<br>
> Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible<br>
> To feeling as to sight? or art thou but<br>
> A dagger of the mind, a false creation,<br>
> Proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain?<br>
> I see thee yet, in form as palpable<br>
> As this which now I draw.<br>
> Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going;<br>
> And such an instrument I was to use.<br>
> Mine eyes are made the fools o’ th’ other senses,<br>
> Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;<br>
> And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,<br>
> Which was not so before. There’s no such thing:<br>
> It is the bloody business which informs<br>
> Thus to mine eyes. Now o’er the one half-world<br>
> Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse<br>
> The curtain’d sleep; witchcraft celebrates<br>
> Pale Hecate’s offerings; and wither’d Murder,<br>
> Alarum’d by his sentinel, the wolf,<br>
> Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.<br>
> With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design<br>
> Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,<br>
> Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear<br>
> Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,<br>
> And take the present horror from the time,<br>
> Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:<br>
> Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.<br>
><br>
> I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.<br>
> Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell<br>
> That summons thee to heaven or to hell.<br>

Macbeth hallucinates the dagger, testing his own senses as he moves toward Duncan’s chamber.
