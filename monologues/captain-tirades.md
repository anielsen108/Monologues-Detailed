# The Captain’s Tirades — The Father

## Complete Text

> You spin webs round me, woman—filaments of looks and whispers—till I no longer know whose child lives under my roof. You set the servants spying, you send the pastor a tale, you poison the child’s mind with your sugary lies, and still you prate of motherhood! I am the father in name, yet every key is taken from me, every order doubted, every thought dragged before your tribunal. You creep like a white ant through the beams of my house, and when it crashes the world will cry, “See how mad the Captain was!” Madness! It is you that press the delirium to my lips. When I demand proof, you smile; when I touch my own child’s head, you snatch him away as though I were a wolf. What weapon have I left? The law? You twist it. The church? You wheedle it. Honour? You make it sound like tyranny. Then let them all hear me: I will not be smothered under your pillow of tender phrases. I will tear down the curtains, fling open the shutters, show them the devouring female who would suck a man’s brain dry only to call herself angel. Let me be branded monster, so long as for one instant you feel the lash of truth. This is my house! My blood! And sooner than see my son turned into your doll, I would see the hearth cold and the cradle empty.<br>

The Captain rages against Laura’s manipulation, feeling his authority dissolve.
