# Oswald’s Breakdown (“The Sun, Mother…”) — Ghosts

## Complete Text

> The sun, Mother! I can’t bear that the sun shall go down. It has been so splendid all day, and now it’s sinking, sinking—don’t let it! You mustn’t let it grow dark. Everything goes black inside my head when the light fails. Oh, how hot it is!—and how cold. Hold me. No—don’t touch me. My brain is like softened wax; the thoughts run through my fingers. Give me the morphia. You promised—if the attack came again—you promised! I can’t live in this half-life, with the worms crawling through my spine. The sun, do you hear? keep it up! Why do you stare so? Have I said something foolish? I believe the lamp is smoking. No, it’s my mind. Mother, you mustn’t cry. Sit quite still. When I was a boy we used to sit in the conservatory at home and watch the sun set; Father laughed then—didn’t he? I can’t remember. Everything is so tired. Look at me, Mother. When the darkness comes, you will give me the pills. Promise. Say it aloud. The sun!—oh, I can’t stand it—Mother, the sun, the sun!<br>

Oswald succumbs to inherited illness, pleading with his mother for mercy.
