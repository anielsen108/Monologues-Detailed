# Peer Gynt Self-Examination (Act V) — Peer Gynt

## Complete Text

> What was I? Emperor of buttons, king of smoke? Have I ever been myself at all? Here I stand in the old age of my lies, with the Button Moulder waiting to melt me down into nothing. I have wrestled with trolls, sailed round the world, stolen wives and titles, told stories so vast that even I believed them. Yet when I search my heart, it is like opening a cupboard full of masks. My mother’s sighs, Solveig’s song—they were the only true things, and I ran from them. I thought freedom meant to live in fragments, to dodge every net; now I see I was only a bubble blown by the wind. Button Moulder! give me time. If there is one deed, one honest word that bears my name, let me find it before you toss me into your ladle. Maybe in Solveig’s prayer there is a Peer who was true, a boy who dared to love. If she cannot answer for me, then let the ladle take me; I deserve to be re-minted as scrap. But if somewhere, in a corner of another soul, the real Peer still lives, let me go to him. Let me be myself once, before the mould closes.<br>

Peer confronts the Button Moulder and weighs whether he ever lived authentically.
