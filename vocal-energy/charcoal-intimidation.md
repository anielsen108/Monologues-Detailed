# Charcoal Intimidation

_Interrogation chamber chill, calculated menace, and silent-threat leverage._

Use for villains who never raise their voices, corporate enforcers, or rulers who let silence burn.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx low for smoky dominance.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use a narrow, controlled AES line so whispers still sting.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum fully for polished menace.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a medium-narrow pharynx that can constrict on key syllables.
- **Tongue root:** Slightly retract the tongue root to load consonants with threat.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a minimal jaw opening that barely parts, increasing tension.
- **Lip shape:** Keep lips thin and pressed, releasing only to articulate ultimatums.
- **False vocal folds:** Allow a hint of controlled constriction for charcoal grain.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ tight, deliberate adduction for laser-focused intimidation.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thicker folds to convey weight even at low volume.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with restrained, pressurized airflow like steam behind a valve.
