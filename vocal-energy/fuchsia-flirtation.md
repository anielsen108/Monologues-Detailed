# Fuchsia Flirtation

_Cat-and-mouse teasing, electric attraction, and playful provocation._

Use for lines that wink, bait, or promise mischief wrapped in charm.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx buoyant and mid-to-high for a sparkling tease.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use quick, bright AES darts to punctuate innuendo.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum but let a glancing buzz leak in for mischievous texture.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a narrower, focused pharynx that keeps the tone precise.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root forward for crisp articulation of double meanings.
- **Jaw aperture:** Employ a nimble jaw opening that can snap shut on secrets.
- **Lip shape:** Flit between pouts and sly spreads to paint each consonant.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract thoroughly so the tone stays light and flirtatious.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Use quick, elastic adduction that releases easily.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Lean toward thinner folds for agile glides and quick leaps.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Pulse the airflow like a giggle: short bursts, then soft suspensions.
