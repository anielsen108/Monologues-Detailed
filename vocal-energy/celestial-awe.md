# Celestial Awe

_Devotional, visionary, and transcendent imagery._

Choose this for oaths, prayers, prophecies, and moments that look beyond the mortal world.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Let the larynx float neutral-to-slightly high to suggest uplift.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use a clear AES narrowing for bell-like brilliance without strain.
- **Velum (nasality):** Velum tall and sealed to keep the tone pure and ringing.
- **Pharynx width:** Stretch the pharynx vertically for cathedral-like space.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root neutral or gently forward to maintain clarity.
- **Jaw aperture:** Allow a released, almost awe-struck jaw drop.
- **Lip shape:** Round or sculpt the lips to create a haloed resonance.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract completely so the sound stays luminous.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Aim for balanced, centered adduction—firm but never pressed.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thinner folds (CT tilt) for shimmer, blending TA for weighty vows.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Sustain a low, anchored breath flow to keep the line floating.
