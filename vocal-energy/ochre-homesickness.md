# Ochre Homesickness

_Field-dust longing, firelight storytelling, and ache for familiar soil._

Use when recalling humble origins, missing family tables, or yearning for land left behind.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx slightly low, as though weighted by distance.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use modest AES focus so the tone stays earthy.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum but allow a rustic buzz, like wind through boards.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a broad pharynx that narrows briefly when tears threaten.
- **Tongue root:** Let the tongue root hang neutral so vowels feel unvarnished.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a relaxed jaw with slow, deliberate opening, like chewing memories.
- **Lip shape:** Favor open, unpretentious lips with occasional rounded sobs.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to keep the ache warm instead of harsh.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ medium adduction so the stories carry without force.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Blend thicker folds for soil-deep resonance with lighter touches on wistful lines.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Let breath move like a slow wagon, steady and dust-laden.
