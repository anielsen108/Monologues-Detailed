# Crimson Command

_Fiery civic authority and battle-ready proclamations._

Use this color whenever the speaker must sound like a commander, magistrate, or war leader rallying the crowd.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx neutral-to-low for a dark/round column that implies rank.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Add a firm AES narrowing to cut through space without shouting.
- **Velum (nasality):** Keep the velum fully raised for a clear, non-nasal civic tone.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a moderately narrowed pharynx to focus the beam while retaining warmth.
- **Tongue root:** Stay neutral-to-slightly forward so consonants stay crisp under pressure.
- **Jaw aperture:** Open the jaw easily to let power bloom without clamp.
- **Lip shape:** Hold lips in a strong neutral line, rounding only on grand vowels.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract false folds aggressively to avoid harsh constriction.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Use solid, balanced adduction—never breathy, never pinched.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thicker TA engagement for chesty weight, easing toward CT on high shouts.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Drive a steady, compressed breath stream to keep the decree energized.
