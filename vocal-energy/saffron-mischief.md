# Saffron Mischief

_Trickster pranks, clever prattle, and irreverent delight._

Use when plotting schemes, poking the powerful, or stirring laughter with audacious wit.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx buoyant and ready to bounce.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Employ a zesty AES sparkle for comic precision.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum but let flickers of nasal buzz color the jokes.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a nimble, mid-width pharynx that can narrow on jabs.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root forward for agile, sprightly diction.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a springy jaw that darts open and shut like a jack-in-the-box.
- **Lip shape:** Snap between puckers and grins to underline punchlines.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract fully so the tone remains playful, not harsh.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose quick, elastic adduction that can release into laughter instantly.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thinner folds for nimble patter.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Use darting bursts of air, then sip quickly for the next antic.
