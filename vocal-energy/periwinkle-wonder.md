# Periwinkle Wonder

_Aurora-like awe, childlike marvel, and whispered discovery._

Use when marveling at miracles, describing strange beauty, or rediscovering the world.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-high to float on curiosity.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use a light AES glimmer to sprinkle stardust across phrases.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum yet allow breath to spill through like fog.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a wide pharynx to open the sonic sky.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root forward, ready for quick, astonished diction.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a gently opening jaw that mimics widened eyes.
- **Lip shape:** Round lips into small o’s on wonderment, then spread softly to share joy.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract fully so nothing interrupts the glow.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose light, floaty adduction for breathy awe.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thinner folds to keep the sound airy and lifted.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Let breath drift upward like lanterns, fueling each revelation.
