# Alabaster Purity

_Calm honesty, vows, and unguarded confession._

Use when a speaker must sound pristine, reverent, or newly absolved.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-low so the sound remains velvety instead of shrill.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Maintain a mostly open AES; only a hint of shimmer is needed for clarity.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum fully to prevent any nasal tint that would cloud the sincerity.
- **Pharynx width:** Open the pharynx for cathedral-like space and floating overtones.
- **Tongue root:** Let the tongue root stay neutral, releasing any grip that might suggest tension.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use an easy, moderate jaw drop that keeps vowels pure and legato.
- **Lip shape:** Round the lips slightly for luminous, bell-like vowels.
- **False vocal folds:** Keep the false folds retracted for a crystalline, spin-free tone.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Favor light-to-medium adduction so the delivery feels honest rather than forceful.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Lean toward thinner, CT-driven coordination for heady transparency.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with steady but gentle airflow, as though lifting a candle flame.
