# Rose Devotion

_Romantic pledge, heartfelt worship, and vow-laden ardor._

Use for swearing fidelity, pledging service, or confessing love with ceremony.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx slightly lowered for lush sincerity.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Apply a gentle AES sheen to keep the pledge ringing.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum fully for velvety openness.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a broad, blooming pharynx that can narrow on tears.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root relaxed so vowels stay generous.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a smooth jaw opening, like offering a flower with two hands.
- **Lip shape:** Favor rounded lips that cradle terms of endearment.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract completely to keep the color plush and pure.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ medium adduction with legato, caressing onsets.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Blend medium-thick folds for warmth with CT shimmer on whispered devotion.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with steady, ribbon-like airflow to sustain long phrases of promise.
