# Lavender Tenderness

_Soft caretaking, lullaby pacing, and gentle forgiveness._

Use for comforting children, calming grief, or patching fragile trust.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-low for plush, pillow-like resonance.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Stay mostly open with only the slightest AES focus so phrases stay feathery.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum but let breathiness paint the edges.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a wide pharynx to create a blanket of sound.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root loose and forward, avoiding any sharpness.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a relaxed jaw with rounded movements that feel like rocking.
- **Lip shape:** Favor rounded lips that smooth out consonants and cradle vowels.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract fully; tenderness loses power when grit appears.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose light, even adduction for hushed sincerity.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Lean toward thinner folds with occasional thicker pulses on vows of protection.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Let breath roll gently, as though fanning someone back to peace.
