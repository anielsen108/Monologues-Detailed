# Violet Lament

_Grief, mourning, and exhausted sorrow._

Choose this when the text sinks into loss, funereal recollection, or ache-filled retrospection.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx low to let sorrow sound dark and round.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Leave the AES more open; too much ring feels insincere.
- **Velum (nasality):** Velum mostly raised, but allow tiny leaks to mimic a sob if needed.
- **Pharynx width:** Hold the pharynx wide for a covered, mournful warmth.
- **Tongue root:** Let the tongue root relax or slightly retract to add ache.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a heavy jaw drop so phrases can “fall” under their own weight.
- **Lip shape:** Round the lips gently; avoid aggressive spreads.
- **False vocal folds:** Keep them retracted but soft, allowing a hint of breathiness.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Moderate adduction—too much squeeze kills the lament.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Blend TA warmth with CT lift so the grief can both resonate and sigh.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Slow, even airflow supports the sense of tolling inevitability.
