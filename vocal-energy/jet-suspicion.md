# Jet Suspicion

_Interrogative darkness, clandestine stakes, and constant vigilance._

Use for cross-examinations, whispered conspiracies, or mistrustful asides.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx low-to-mid for a shadowed, coiled presence.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use a tight AES thread so questions pierce without volume.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum to keep the color polished and predatory.
- **Pharynx width:** Narrow the pharynx slightly to laser-focus the tone.
- **Tongue root:** Hold the tongue root subtly retracted to add tension, releasing only to strike.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a controlled jaw opening that rarely relaxes fully.
- **Lip shape:** Keep lips thin and precise, letting them spread on accusations.
- **False vocal folds:** Allow a controlled hint of constriction for smoky menace, then retract fast.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Favor tight, deliberate adduction for interrogative stabs.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Use medium-thick folds to keep the sound grounded and relentless.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Manage breath in short, stealthy bursts, as if guarding secrets.
