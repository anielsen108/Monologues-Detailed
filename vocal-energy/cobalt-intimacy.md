# Cobalt Intimacy

_Soft confessions, whispered bargains, and personal pleas._

Use for hushed admissions, secret-sharing, or any line meant for one trusted ear.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Let the larynx settle low-to-neutral for smoky closeness.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Open the AES slightly so the tone stays velvety, not piercing.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum but allow a hint of nasality if you want intimacy.
- **Pharynx width:** Keep the pharynx comfortably wide for warm, hushed vowels.
- **Tongue root:** Release the tongue root forward so vowels stay clear even at low volume.
- **Jaw aperture:** Maintain a relaxed, smaller jaw drop to suggest confidentiality.
- **Lip shape:** Round or neutral lips help the sound feel cushioned and secretive.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to keep airflow free at the softer dynamic.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Use lighter adduction so the sound can hover without force.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Lean toward thinner folds (CT tilt) so pianissimo lines stay supported.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Feed a gentle, continuous stream; imagine fogging a window.
