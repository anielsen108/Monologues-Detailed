# Peach Consolation

_Sunlit comfort, neighborly warmth, and patient reassurance._

Use when tending to small disappointments, convincing someone to stay, or smoothing over social bumps.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx gently lowered for a pillowy base.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Maintain an open AES with just enough focus to keep the smile audible.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum but let a tiny nasal glow show homey sincerity.
- **Pharynx width:** Hold a broad pharynx that wraps around the listener like a shawl.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root relaxed, occasionally advancing to brighten assurances.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a soft jaw opening with rounded, nurturing movements.
- **Lip shape:** Favor rounded lips that feel like offering a cup of tea.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract fully so nothing scratchy intrudes on comfort.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ light-to-medium adduction with gentle, rocking onsets.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Blend thin folds for sweetness with brief thicker pulses on promises.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Let breath move in slow, sigh-like waves.
