# Obsidian Fury

_Menace, vengeance, and smoldering rage._

Choose this when the voice must threaten, accuse, or unleash wrath with dark heat.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Drop the larynx slightly for a darker, dangerous timbre.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Keep a narrowed AES so the bite still cuts through.
- **Velum (nasality):** Seal the velum to avoid any nasal buzz that would blunt the threat.
- **Pharynx width:** Open the pharynx for cavernous heat and overtones.
- **Tongue root:** Slightly retract the tongue root to add grit, but don’t swallow vowels.
- **Jaw aperture:** Let the jaw hang open enough for resonance while keeping a clenched undertone.
- **Lip shape:** Use more spread or sneering lips to expose consonant attacks.
- **False vocal folds:** Allow a touch of false-fold engagement for texture, without full constriction.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Lean into firm adduction for a tight, searing core.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thicker TA mass for chest-driven weight.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with compressed breath so the fury simmers instead of shouts.
