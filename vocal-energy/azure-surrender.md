# Azure Surrender

_Soft capitulation, truce-seeking, and humbled realization._

Use when a character accepts fate, offers apology, or lays down arms.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Let the larynx settle slightly low to convey a sighing release.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Keep the AES relaxed and open so the tone feels surrendered, not sharp.
- **Velum (nasality):** Lift the velum but allow a faint veil of nasality for a weary edge.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain generous pharyngeal space so phrases fall like waves.
- **Tongue root:** Release the tongue root forward to avoid defensive tightness.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use an easy, slack jaw that shows the fight has left the body.
- **Lip shape:** Keep lips neutral-to-rounded, letting consonants blur softly.
- **False vocal folds:** Fully retract the false folds to prevent any growl from sneaking in.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Aim for gentle adduction with slightly airy offsets.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thinner folds that lean toward head register for a floating surrender.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Feed a slow, even breath like an exhale of resignation.
