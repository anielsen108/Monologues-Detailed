# Verdant Compassion

_Nurturing kindness, warmth, and humane persuasion._

Use for pastoral comfort, coaxing hope, or any invitation grounded in empathy.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-low to sound rooted and kind.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use only a gentle AES pinch so the tone stays round yet audible.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum for clear warmth, letting just a hint drop if you want tenderness.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a wide, open pharynx for enveloping resonance.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root relaxed and slightly forward for pure vowels.
- **Jaw aperture:** Let the jaw release so the sound feels generous.
- **Lip shape:** Favor rounded or heart-shaped lips that feel embracing.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to keep everything free and compassionate.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Balanced-to-light closure keeps the tone buoyant.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Blend thinner folds with a hint of TA to keep warmth without heaviness.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with a buoyant, steady airflow that feels like a hand on the shoulder.
