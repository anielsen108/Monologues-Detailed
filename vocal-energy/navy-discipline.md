# Navy Discipline

_Military cadence, tactical brevity, and stoic chain-of-command focus._

Use when issuing clipped orders, negotiating battlefield logistics, or reminding troops of duty.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx neutral for clean authority.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Employ a tight AES beam so words slice through chaos without extra volume.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum completely; nasal buzz undermines discipline.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a medium width that can narrow when emphasis is required.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root steady and forward for crisp consonants.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a controlled jaw opening with minimal wobble.
- **Lip shape:** Favor taut lips that snap into place on commands.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract firmly to keep the tone clean and obedient.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Use firm, even adduction with percussive onsets.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor medium-thick folds to carry through outdoor noise.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with clipped, metered airflow timed to marching strides.
