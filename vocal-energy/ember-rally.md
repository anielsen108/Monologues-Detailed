# Ember Rally

_Propulsive surges, urgent lifts, and crowd-stirring momentum._

This color fuels crescendos, rising appeals, and any “on-your-feet” momentum swing.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Allow the larynx to float mid-to-high for bright, energetic ping.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Narrow the AES enough to keep sparkle and projection.
- **Velum (nasality):** Lift the velum fully so the sound stays clear as energy spikes.
- **Pharynx width:** Keep the pharynx mid-width so vowels stay agile even while excited.
- **Tongue root:** Stay neutral and buoyant; avoid retraction that would slow the line.
- **Jaw aperture:** Let the jaw swing freely with quick openings for rhythmic punches.
- **Lip shape:** Use flexible lips—slight spreads on bright syllables, quick rounding for momentum pivots.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to maintain freedom even in fast, urgent phrases.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Aim for balanced adduction; enough closure for brilliance without choking airflow.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Blend CT tilt with TA depth so high pitches remain supported but gutsy.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Pulse a steady but lively airflow; think constant “lean” rather than brute push.
