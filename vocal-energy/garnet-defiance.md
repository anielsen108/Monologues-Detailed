# Garnet Defiance

_Rebellious fire, boundary-setting, and warrior refusal._

Use for moments of protest, counterpunches, or vows that dare the opposition.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-level, ready to drop for weight or rise for a cutting barb.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Engage a sharp AES edge that slices through authority.
- **Velum (nasality):** Seal the velum so the color stays iron-clad and direct.
- **Pharynx width:** Alternate between broad, open space for rallying lines and quick narrowings for pointed threats.
- **Tongue root:** Allow slight retraction to load consonants with bite, then release for clarity.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a dynamic jaw: wide on declarations, clenched on daring pauses.
- **Lip shape:** Flash teeth with spread lips when mocking; round vowels when swearing oaths.
- **False vocal folds:** Keep them mostly retracted, inviting only a trace of rasp for danger.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose firm adduction with precise onsets that sound like drawn blades.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thicker coordination for muscular resistance.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Drive breath like a battle cry, pacing it so each hit lands clean.
