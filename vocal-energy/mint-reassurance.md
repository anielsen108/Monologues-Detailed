# Mint Reassurance

_Fresh calm, clear-headed triage, and restorative cool._

Use when stabilizing panic, coaching deep breaths, or offering a clean slate.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx slightly elevated for a refreshing brightness.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use a gentle AES focus so words sound crisp yet soothing.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum fully for clarifying resonance.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a medium-wide pharynx to keep the airflow smooth and cooling.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root forward and relaxed for uncluttered diction.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a light, easy jaw opening that mirrors gentle breathing exercises.
- **Lip shape:** Favor soft spreads that feel like smiles mixed with instruction.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to keep the timbre decongested and refreshing.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose light-to-medium adduction for patient steadiness.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thinner folds with glints of thicker support when promising safety.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Guide airflow like a cooling breeze, steady and cleansing.
