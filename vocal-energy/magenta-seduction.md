# Magenta Seduction

_Velvet allure, persuasive decadence, and dangerous charm._

Use when luring someone closer, tempting betrayal, or intoxicating a listener.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx low-to-mid for sultry depth.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Apply a narrow, slow AES shimmer to add sensual sparkles.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum to maintain lush clarity; no nasal leak allowed.
- **Pharynx width:** Keep the pharynx wide and shadowy like candlelit velvet.
- **Tongue root:** Let the tongue root release slightly back for smoky vowels, then glide forward on promises.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use languid jaw movements, opening slowly as if savoring each syllable.
- **Lip shape:** Favor rounded, luxuriant lips with occasional teasing spreads.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to keep the tone silken and frictionless.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ firm but gentle adduction to create a plush, intimate buzz.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thicker folds for warmth, blending CT on caressing phrases.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Feed a slow, scented airflow that lingers between words like perfume.
