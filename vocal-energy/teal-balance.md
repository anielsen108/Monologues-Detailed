# Teal Balance

_Mediating poise, restorative negotiation, and centering breath._

Use for bridging factions, facilitating compromise, or aligning head and heart.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx neutral, allowing quick shifts toward either warmth or brightness.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Maintain a mild AES focus for clarity without edge.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum for pure vowels that inspire trust.
- **Pharynx width:** Hold a medium-wide pharynx that can subtly adjust to mirror each side.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root relaxed and ready to mirror other dialects or energies.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a fluid jaw opening that adapts moment to moment.
- **Lip shape:** Keep lips supple, able to round for empathy or spread for logic.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to keep the energy clear and diplomatic.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose balanced adduction with gently tapered onsets.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor medium thickness, enabling both warmth and brightness.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with calm, even airflow like a mediator’s steady heartbeat.
