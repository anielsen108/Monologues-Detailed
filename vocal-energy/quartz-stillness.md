# Quartz Stillness

_Meditative pause, frozen clarity, and crystalline suspension._

Use when time seems to stop—observing miracles, weighing crucial decisions, or holding a silent vigil.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx neutral and barely moving to preserve stillness.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Maintain minimal AES activity; the tone should shimmer softly, not pierce.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum fully for glass-clear vowels.
- **Pharynx width:** Hold a steady, medium-wide pharynx that feels immovable.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root neutral, as if suspending any impulse to interfere.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a small, sustained jaw opening that barely shifts.
- **Lip shape:** Keep lips gently rounded or neutral, minimizing movement to focus attention.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to keep the sound pure and undisturbed.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ light, even adduction for sustained pianissimo lines.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thinner folds for an almost glassy tone.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with slow, controlled airflow like holding a single breath of winter air.
