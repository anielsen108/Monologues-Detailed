# Platinum Detachment

_Cool remove, urbane analysis, and surgical emotional distance._

Use for scenes requiring diplomatic neutrality, icy manipulation, or corporate control.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-level to avoid warmth or growl.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Employ a slim AES focus to maintain clarity without heat.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum fully for polished, unmarred vowels.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a moderate pharynx, never fully released nor clenched.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root poised and forward so consonants feel precise and remote.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a controlled jaw opening with minimal dynamic range.
- **Lip shape:** Favor centered, composed lips—no excessive smile or pout.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract thoroughly; friction would betray emotion.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose medium adduction for steady, even delivery.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Lean toward thinner folds for a glassy finish.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with cool, metered airflow like climate-controlled air.
