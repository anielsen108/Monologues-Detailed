# Emerald Hope

_Renewal, patient optimism, and life-affirming persuasion._

Use when nurturing resilience, describing healing, or promising a second spring.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx neutral so optimism feels grounded, not giddy.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Add a gentle AES focus to keep the tone shining like new leaves.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum completely for clean, open vowels.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a wide, buoyant pharynx to let warmth bloom.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root easy and forward for inviting diction.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a relaxed jaw that can widen on promises and narrow on recollections.
- **Lip shape:** Favor rounded lips to cradle imagery, with soft spreads when sharing smiles.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract fully to maintain effortless uplift.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose medium adduction so the message feels steady and trustworthy.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Balance fold thickness for both compassion and sparkle.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with a springy, even airflow like wind through grass.
