# Vocal Energy Guide

Actors requested a repeatable way to interpret every bracketed intention/energy/tone cue across these monologues. The guide below introduces the shared resonator spectrum, then links to each emotional-color grouping so you can dial the exact setup before reviewing a monologue’s `Vocal Energy Guidance` section.

| Resonator / control            | Spectrum (← →)              | Tonal effect (← →)                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Larynx height**              | low → high                  | dark/round → bright/edgy                   |
| **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”** | open → narrowed             | soft/hollow → ring/projection              |
| **Velum (nasality)**           | lowered → raised            | nasal/buzzy → clear/non-nasal              |
| **Pharynx width**              | wide → narrower             | warm/covered → focused/bright              |
| **Tongue root** †              | retracted → forward/neutral | woofy/muffled → bright/clear               |
| **Jaw aperture** †             | small → larger (easy)       | thin/closed → fuller/warm                  |
| **Lip shape** †                | spread → rounded/protruded  | bright → dark/rich                         |
| **False vocal folds**          | constricted → retracted     | harsh/noisy → clean/free                   |
| **Vocal-fold adduction**       | less → more                 | airy/soft → tight/grainy (best = balanced) |
| **Fold thickness (CT↔TA)**     | thin → thick                | heady/sparkly → chesty/warm                |
| **Breath pressure/flow**       | low → higher/steady         | weak/flat → energetic/brassy               |

## How to use this guide

1. Review the spectrum table to remind yourself what happens when you shift each control point.
2. Open any color page from the directory to see how that emotional hue manipulates the spectrum.
3. Jump into a monologue page and scroll to `## Vocal Energy Guidance`. Each category listed there links back to its color page so you can reset your setup between cue clusters.
