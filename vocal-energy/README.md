# Vocal Energy Guide

Actors requested a repeatable way to interpret every bracketed intention/energy/tone cue across these monologues. The guide below introduces the shared resonator spectrum, then links to each emotional-color grouping so you can dial the exact setup before reviewing a monologue’s `Vocal Energy Guidance` section.

| Resonator / control            | Spectrum (← →)              | Tonal effect (← →)                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Larynx height**              | low → high                  | dark/round → bright/edgy                   |
| **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”** | open → narrowed             | soft/hollow → ring/projection              |
| **Velum (nasality)**           | lowered → raised            | nasal/buzzy → clear/non-nasal              |
| **Pharynx width**              | wide → narrower             | warm/covered → focused/bright              |
| **Tongue root** †              | retracted → forward/neutral | woofy/muffled → bright/clear               |
| **Jaw aperture** †             | small → larger (easy)       | thin/closed → fuller/warm                  |
| **Lip shape** †                | spread → rounded/protruded  | bright → dark/rich                         |
| **False vocal folds**          | constricted → retracted     | harsh/noisy → clean/free                   |
| **Vocal-fold adduction**       | less → more                 | airy/soft → tight/grainy (best = balanced) |
| **Fold thickness (CT↔TA)**     | thin → thick                | heady/sparkly → chesty/warm                |
| **Breath pressure/flow**       | low → higher/steady         | weak/flat → energetic/brassy               |
