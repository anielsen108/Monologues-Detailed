# Copper Tenacity

_Gritty persistence, working-class strength, and grounded resolve._

Use for speeches that grind through obstacles, bargain with fate, or refuse to yield.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-low to anchor the fight in the body.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Employ a focused AES edge that slices through without screaming.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum but let a hint of nasal buzz show the laboring breath.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a medium width—enough warmth to sound human, enough focus to punch.
- **Tongue root:** Slightly retract the tongue root for grit, then release on key words.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a firm jaw opening that feels like clenched determination easing open.
- **Lip shape:** Keep lips neutral-to-pressed, releasing into rounded vowels only when promising hope.
- **False vocal folds:** Allow minimal false-fold texture so the sound feels lived-in yet controlled.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Lean into firm adduction for hammer-like articulation.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thicker TA dominance to supply muscular weight.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Drive breath like piston strokes—consistent, forceful, but never frantic.
