# Jade Mercy

_Therapeutic calm, compassionate mediation, and healing touch._

Use when soothing wounded pride, easing panic, or offering amnesty.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx slightly low for a balm-like tone.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Maintain an open AES with just enough focus to be heard up close.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum yet let a breathy halo soften the edges.
- **Pharynx width:** Hold a wide, cushiony pharynx for enveloping warmth.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root loose and forward to avoid accidental pressure.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a relaxed jaw that can widen gently on words like “breathe” or “rest.”
- **Lip shape:** Favor rounded lips, smoothing consonants like stroking hair.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract completely so the sound never scratches the listener.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ light-to-medium adduction with compassionate onsets.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Lean toward thinner folds with occasional thicker pulses when promising protection.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Keep a slow, consistent airflow that feels like rocking someone to sleep.
