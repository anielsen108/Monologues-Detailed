# Bronze Heritage

_Ancestral weight, ritual dignity, and storied lineage._

Use when invoking forebears, ceremonies, or institutional memory.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Lower the larynx slightly for heirloom warmth and gravity.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Keep a modest AES pinch so authority projects without sounding strident.
- **Velum (nasality):** Seal the velum to keep the resonance noble and unmarred.
- **Pharynx width:** Sustain a wide, columnar pharynx for resonant, bell-metal overtones.
- **Tongue root:** Let the tongue root hover neutral, avoiding excessive retraction that would muddy diction.
- **Jaw aperture:** Maintain a measured, ceremonial jaw opening that elongates vowels.
- **Lip shape:** Round the lips to sculpt stately, resonant consonants.
- **False vocal folds:** Keep false folds retracted to ensure the tone remains ceremonial rather than angry.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Use balanced, medium-firm adduction suited to oaths and proclamations.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Blend TA heft with CT clarity for both resonance and intelligibility.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with steady, grounded breath like a processional drumbeat.
