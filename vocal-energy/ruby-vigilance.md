# Ruby Vigilance

_Border-guard readiness, quick defensive strikes, and watchful fury._

Use for characters who scan horizons, challenge intruders, or guard sacred vows.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-level with the ability to snap higher for alarms.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Engage a keen AES spear so alerts travel instantly.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum to keep the signal clear.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a focused, medium-narrow pharynx for concentrated energy.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root coiled and ready, releasing forward on commands.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a controlled jaw that can burst open on shouts of warning.
- **Lip shape:** Keep lips taut and precise, exposing teeth when threatening.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract but allow a flash of grit when sounding the alarm.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose firm adduction for unwavering vigilance.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor medium-thick folds to project authority over distance.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Manage quick, pressurized bursts of breath like signal flares.
