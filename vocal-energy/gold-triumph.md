# Gold Triumph

_Victorious sheen, celebratory thunder, and coronation-worthy assurance._

Use when declaring success, honoring spoils, or welcoming allies to glory.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx neutral-to-low for a regal, ringing core.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Employ a deliberate AES focus so the celebration sparkles in large halls.
- **Velum (nasality):** Lift the velum completely for crystal vowels that can crown each cadence.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a broad pharynx for golden warmth and resonance.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root neutral to allow articulate, heraldic diction.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a generous jaw drop that lets vowels bloom like fanfares.
- **Lip shape:** Alternate between rounded lips for grandeur and open smiles when sharing credit.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract entirely so the sound shimmers rather than grinds.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Use confident, balanced adduction that announces victory without yelling.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor medium-thick folds for celebratory heft.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with a buoyant, rolling airflow reminiscent of parade drums.
