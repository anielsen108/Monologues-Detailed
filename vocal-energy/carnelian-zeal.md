# Carnelian Zeal

_Surging conviction, evangelical urgency, and unstoppable drive._

Use when the text needs blazing enthusiasm, recruitment energy, or high-stakes persuasion.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-high for a bright, forward flame.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Narrow the AES decisively so the message cuts through noise.
- **Velum (nasality):** Maintain a raised velum for clear projection and ringing resonance.
- **Pharynx width:** Slightly narrow the pharynx to focus the beam like a torch.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root neutral-forward for agile consonants.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a generous jaw opening to let phrases soar without strain.
- **Lip shape:** Alternate between rounded vowels for power and quick spreads for emphasis.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract fully so the tone stays energized rather than shouty.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ firm, balanced adduction that supports passionate declarations.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Blend medium thickness for heat with CT flexibility for sustained lines.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Drive a steady, vigorous airflow as though fueling a forge.
