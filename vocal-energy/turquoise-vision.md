# Turquoise Vision

_Futurist imagination, lighthouse rhetoric, and horizon-pointing inspiration._

Use when painting new worlds, promising innovation, or guiding followers toward unseen shores.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-high for aerial lift.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Apply a clear AES shimmer that shoots ideas like beams of light.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum fully so the signal stays pure.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a wide pharynx that can flare even wider on visionary imagery.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root forward for articulate, optimistic diction.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use an open, sky-reaching jaw on key imagery.
- **Lip shape:** Round lips for big-picture words, then spread slightly when inviting others to join.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to keep the timbre translucent and uplifting.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ medium adduction with buoyant, ascending onsets.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor medium-thin folds to keep the tone light enough to soar.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with continuous, glider-like airflow to keep visions aloft.
