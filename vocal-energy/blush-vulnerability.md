# Blush Vulnerability

_Gentle confession, shy attraction, and hesitant hope._

Use when revealing secrets of the heart or asking for mercy without armor.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-level with occasional lifts on uncertain words.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Let the AES stay mostly open so the tone remains breath-kissed and delicate.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum, but allow a whisper of nasality that sounds human and shy.
- **Pharynx width:** Keep a warm, medium width that cushions every syllable.
- **Tongue root:** Let the tongue root float forward for articulate yet tremulous clarity.
- **Jaw aperture:** Maintain a small-to-medium opening, as if words might retreat at any moment.
- **Lip shape:** Alternate between rounded vowels and slight spreads to show flickers of courage.
- **False vocal folds:** Keep false folds retracted; vulnerability shouldn’t rasp.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Use light adduction with tender onsets, saving firmness for rare bursts.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thinner folds with flashes of thicker engagement when emotion spikes.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Let breath flow softly, catching now and then like someone swallowing feelings.
