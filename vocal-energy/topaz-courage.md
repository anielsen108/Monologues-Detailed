# Topaz Courage

_Steady bravery, trailblazing curiosity, and sun-hardened grit._

Use when encouraging others to take the first step, cross deserts, or face danger with bright resolve.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-high for a fearless gleam.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use a decisive AES ring so bravery radiates outward.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum to keep vowels clear and inspiring.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a medium-wide pharynx that can flare open on “forward” moments.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root forward to articulate commands without weight.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a confident jaw drop that never fully collapses.
- **Lip shape:** Alternate between rounded encouragement and quick spreads that signal action.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract so the tone stays luminous even under stress.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ firm, clean adduction for unwavering determination.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor medium thickness that can lean chestward on heroic calls.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Feed steady, solar-powered airflow, always pushing momentum.
