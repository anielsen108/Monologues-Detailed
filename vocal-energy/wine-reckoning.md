# Wine Reckoning

_Confessional intoxication, midnight truth, and indulgent collapse._

Use when a character spills secrets over drink, loves too hard, or teeters between laughter and tears.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-low, wobbling gently like someone a glass deep.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Maintain a softened AES so the tone blurs at the edges.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum but let breathiness leak through for tipsy honesty.
- **Pharynx width:** Use a wide, relaxed pharynx that occasionally collapses on sobs.
- **Tongue root:** Allow the tongue root to drift, then reset forward when clarity returns.
- **Jaw aperture:** Keep the jaw loose and slack, ready to sag into confession.
- **Lip shape:** Let lips wander between sloppy roundness and sudden tight truths.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract enough to avoid harsh scraping, allowing momentary flutter when emotion spills over.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Use inconsistent adduction—breathy on secrets, firmer on accusations.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Alternate between thicker, chesty blurts and thinner, heady laughter.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Let breath stumble in uneven waves, as though words ride a spinning room.
