# Opal Curiosity

_Sparked imagination, investigative wonder, and iridescent questioning._

Use when hypothesizing, exploring mysteries, or delighting in unexpected connections.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-high for inquisitive lift.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Apply a playful AES shimmer to make discoveries glitter.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum fully so vowels stay bright and alert.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a medium width that expands when possibilities widen.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root forward and nimble to articulate quick thoughts.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use an agile jaw with light bounces that follow the mind’s leaps.
- **Lip shape:** Alternate between rounded oohs of surprise and spread smiles when ideas click.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract completely to keep curiosity weightless.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose light-to-medium adduction for buoyant inquiry.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thinner folds for quick pivoting phrases.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Let breath bubble in short, excited bursts, then reset for the next discovery.
