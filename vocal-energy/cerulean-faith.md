# Cerulean Faith

_Avowed trust, devotional steadiness, and patient belief._

Use when voicing prayerful confidence, reassurance, or principled loyalty.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx neutral, allowing calm equilibrium.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Apply a light AES focus to keep the tone buoyant without aggression.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum for clear, open vowels suited to sacred language.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a wide pharynx so the resonance feels chapel-like and enveloping.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root neutral-forward for articulate promises.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a medium jaw opening that lets lines unspool smoothly.
- **Lip shape:** Favor rounded lips with occasional relaxed spreads to underscore certainty.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract completely so the color remains serene and unwavering.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose balanced adduction with gentle onsets, as if offering blessings.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Lean toward medium thickness, fusing warmth with clarity.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with even, prayer-like breath that never rushes the cadence.
