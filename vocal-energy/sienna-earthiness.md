# Sienna Earthiness

_Rugged authenticity, agrarian pragmatism, and soil-rich storytelling._

Use when speaking as a laborer, grounding lofty plans, or invoking the land’s wisdom.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx low for loamy resonance.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use a moderate AES edge so the voice still carries across fields.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum but allow a grainy buzz for rustic honesty.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a wide pharynx to let the tone feel sun-baked and open.
- **Tongue root:** Let the tongue root sit relaxed with occasional retraction on stubborn consonants.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a heavy, relaxed jaw with deliberate chewing of vowels.
- **Lip shape:** Favor relaxed, open lips with occasional rounded emphasis on proverbs.
- **False vocal folds:** Allow a trace of texture without full constriction—like dirt under the nails.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ firm, even adduction suited to storytelling over tools.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thicker folds for earthy heft.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with steady, plowing airflow that never rushes.
