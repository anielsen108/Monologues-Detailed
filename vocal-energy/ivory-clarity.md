# Ivory Clarity

_Crisp reason, enlightened debate, and transparent conscience._

Use for speeches that distill chaos, lay out evidence, or illuminate ethics.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx neutral to preserve balanced brightness.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use a tidy AES focus for articulate projection.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum fully so vowels stay polished and precise.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain moderate pharyngeal space that can widen when offering empathy.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root forward for clean consonants and quick pivots.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a flexible jaw opening that traces the contours of logical phrasing.
- **Lip shape:** Favor neat, centered lip placement that highlights diction.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to leave the tone spotless and trustworthy.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose balanced adduction for articulate firmness without aggression.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Blend CT agility with light TA presence so the sound feels alive.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with steady airflow that mirrors a measured lecture or closing argument.
