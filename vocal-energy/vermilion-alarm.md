# Vermilion Alarm

_Emergency flare, rapid mobilization, and siren-call warning._

Use when sounding the alarm, reporting imminent danger, or jolting a crowd awake.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx high enough for piercing urgency.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Engage maximal AES ring so warnings cut through any din.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum to keep the blast clean and penetrating.
- **Pharynx width:** Narrow the pharynx for laser-focused immediacy.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root forward for rapid-fire diction.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a snapping jaw that can slam open on danger verbs.
- **Lip shape:** Spread lips to sharpen consonants; round only when commanding retreat.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to avoid shredding; any grit should be intentional, brief, and fiery.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose firm, percussive adduction with explosive onsets.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor medium-thin folds so the signal remains piercing, not muddy.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Blast short, high-pressure bursts like a bugle call.
