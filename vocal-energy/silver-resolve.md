# Silver Resolve

_Measured logic, ceremonial control, and forensic argument._

Choose this for legal reasoning, formal address, or any line that must feel carefully weighed.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx comfortably mid-level to avoid emotional extremes.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Maintain only a mild AES narrowing for intelligibility without excess bite.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum for a clean, court-ready line.
- **Pharynx width:** Hold a medium pharyngeal width so tone feels grounded yet neutral.
- **Tongue root:** Let the tongue root stay neutral for precise consonants.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a moderate jaw drop that supports articulate, even pacing.
- **Lip shape:** Keep lips neutral so vowels remain pure and uncolored.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract fully to keep the stream unobstructed.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Balance adduction—neither breathy nor clenched.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Stay in the middle mix; neither overly chesty nor too heady.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Maintain consistent breath flow, as if reading official testimony.
