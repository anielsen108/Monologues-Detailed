# Mauve Nostalgia

_Soft reminiscence, faded romance, and bittersweet memory._

Use when reliving distant summers, lost loves, or sepia-toned regrets.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-low for dusky warmth.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use minimal AES focus so the tone feels misty.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum yet let a breathy sigh float through.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a wide pharynx that can subtly narrow on painful recollections.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root neutral, occasionally releasing backward for ache.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use an easy jaw that drifts open on long vowels like turning pages.
- **Lip shape:** Favor rounded lips that soften consonants into blurred photographs.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract completely to keep the memory gentle, not gritty.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Choose light-to-medium adduction with legato onsets.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Lean toward thinner folds while allowing thicker swells on emotional peaks.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Let breath drift like dust motes in afternoon light.
