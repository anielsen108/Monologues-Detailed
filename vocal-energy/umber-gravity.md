# Umber Gravity

_Judicial solemnity, elegiac rumble, and burdened leadership._

Use when announcing sentences, mourning losses in public, or acknowledging cost with steady hands.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx lowered for a resonant, earthbound core.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Maintain a modest AES focus to keep the authority audible.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum entirely so the weight feels dignified, not nasal.
- **Pharynx width:** Hold a wide pharynx that resonates like carved wood.
- **Tongue root:** Slightly retract the tongue root for gravitas, then release to prevent muffle.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a heavy, deliberate jaw drop on pronouncements.
- **Lip shape:** Favor broad, steady lips that underline each clause.
- **False vocal folds:** Allow minimal texture for seriousness without letting constriction choke the line.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ firm, even adduction for unshakeable resonance.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor thicker folds for mass and moral weight.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with deep, tectonic airflow like tolling bells.
