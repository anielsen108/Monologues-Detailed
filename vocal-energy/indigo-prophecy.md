# Indigo Prophecy

_Oracular calm, trance-like vision, and midnight revelation._

Use when unveiling dreams, fate, or cosmic warnings delivered from elsewhere.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Lower the larynx slightly for a shadowed, hypnotic base.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Keep the AES relaxed with only a narrow shimmer on key images.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum to preserve otherworldly clarity.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain cavernous pharyngeal space so the tone sounds like it echoes from beyond.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root neutral, as if channeling words rather than crafting them.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a slow, even jaw opening that floats syllables into the air.
- **Lip shape:** Round the lips to sculpt mantra-like vowels.
- **False vocal folds:** Fully retract to keep the trance uncluttered by earthly noise.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Favor gentle, balanced adduction for an entrancing sustain.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Lean toward thinner folds to keep the texture buoyant and ethereal.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Let breath stream steadily, like incense smoke swirling through the temple.
