# Coral Encouragement

_Warm coaching, hopeful uplift, and supportive buoyancy._

Use when you must steady another character’s nerves or cheer an uncertain crowd.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx slightly elevated for a smiling brightness.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Engage light AES twang to send beams of optimism forward.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum but allow a faint nasal shimmer to feel conversational.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a medium-wide pharynx for inclusive warmth.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root relaxed and forward to articulate clearly and kindly.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a comfortable jaw opening with quick releases for laughter-like pulses.
- **Lip shape:** Alternate between rounded vowels for hugs and slight spreads for playful nudges.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract fully so reassurance never sounds stressed.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Use medium adduction with buoyant onsets.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Blend medium fold thickness to keep the tone both warm and agile.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Feed a gently energetic airflow, like fanning embers of someone else’s courage.
