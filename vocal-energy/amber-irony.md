# Amber Irony

_Wry, sardonic, or subversively playful edges._

Use for sarcasm, conspiratorial digs, and razor-smile commentary.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-high for a bright, cutting glaze.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Use a quick, precise AES pinch to highlight the sarcasm shimmer.
- **Velum (nasality):** Velum mostly raised, but allow a trace of nasal buzz when you want smugness.
- **Pharynx width:** Slightly narrow the pharynx to focus the tone like a spotlight.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root neutral-to-forward for nimble diction.
- **Jaw aperture:** Maintain a moderate jaw opening that can snap shut for irony beats.
- **Lip shape:** Favor spread lips to telegraph the sly grin.
- **False vocal folds:** Fully retract to keep the tone clean and agile.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Use medium adduction—tight enough for sparkle, loose enough for quick pivots.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Lean toward thinner CT-driven folds for agile, heady resonance.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Employ a lean, steady flow; think “needlepoint” rather than blast.
