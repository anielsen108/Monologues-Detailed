# Graphite Cynicism

_Dry wit, acid skepticism, and courtroom-grade doubt._

Use when poking holes in speeches, undermining promises, or weaponizing logic.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx mid-to-high to sharpen every barb.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Narrow the AES to deliver pencil-point precision.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum yet allow a glint of nasality for sardonic bite.
- **Pharynx width:** Keep a moderate width that can snap to narrower focus when ridiculing.
- **Tongue root:** Stay neutral-forward to spit consonants cleanly.
- **Jaw aperture:** Maintain a small-to-medium jaw opening, ready for quick clacks on punchlines.
- **Lip shape:** Favor spread lips for smirks, relaxing only when you land the coup de grâce.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract thoroughly to keep the delivery sleek and disdainful.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Use medium-firm adduction so each phrase sounds carved into stone.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Lean toward thinner folds for a cool, steely sheen.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Push lean, efficient airflow that feels like ink scratching across paper.
