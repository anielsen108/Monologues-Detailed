# Slate Pragmatism

_Matter-of-fact counsel, logistical realism, and unsentimental truth._

Use for budget talks, strategic pivots, or any scene where feelings must yield to facts.

## Resonator and control targets

- **Larynx height:** Keep the larynx neutral for even-keeled tone.
- **Epilaryngeal (AES) “twang”:** Apply a moderate AES focus to keep ideas razor-sharp.
- **Velum (nasality):** Raise the velum to eliminate haze.
- **Pharynx width:** Maintain a medium width that stays steady regardless of pushback.
- **Tongue root:** Keep the tongue root forward for clipped, exact consonants.
- **Jaw aperture:** Use a controlled jaw opening with minimal flourish.
- **Lip shape:** Favor compressed lips on key data points, easing only when offering solutions.
- **False vocal folds:** Retract to keep the message efficient and free of clutter.
- **Vocal-fold adduction:** Employ medium-firm adduction for confidence without drama.
- **Fold thickness (CT↔TA):** Favor medium thickness for a grounded but not heavy sound.
- **Breath pressure/flow:** Support with steady, spreadsheet-like airflow.
